## What's up with this login thing?

When we made our first feature, we rented a theater in St. Louis, made a Facebook event, and 100 people showed up with tickets in hand.

We can't do that anymore. You guys are awesome, but you're also spread out, and Facebook isn't what it used to be.

So we're looking to build a list of people who like our movies, and contact them directly when we've got new stuff.

Sound good?

## Will you write on my wall?

No. Seriously, we have principles, and better things to do.

You *should* post about us on Facebook, but that's your decision, not ours.

## Will you spam me?

No. We appreciate you sharing your email address, and we'll use it very sparingly.

## I hate you!

That makes me sad.
